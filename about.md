[I](http://chrisnolan.ca/ "Chris Nolan.ca") really enjoyed [Alex Bello](http://alexbellos.com/)'s book, [The Grapes of Math](http://pages.bloomsbury.com/favouritenumber/alex-through-the-looking-glass), and since I was playing around with [Khan Academy's Computer Science](http://khanacademy.org/cs) stuff at the same time, I thought I'd combine the two and make some interactive programs demonstrating some of the concepts described in the book. 

When I was in High School, I was always coming up with programs that demonstrated what we had been working on from the text book, and I thought this could be a bit like that, but online and possibily collaborative if others are enjoying the book too and want to take a crack at some of the topics.
