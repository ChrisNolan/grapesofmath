Let's get started.  This website is being hosted on [github pages][github pages] and using the [jekyll enginge][jekyll] and the source is available in the [site repositiory][repository] for anyone to contribute to.

I'm going to play around a bit and see how we implement the first example, and then how we'll be navigating around.

{% highlight javascript %}
println("The Grapes of Math website @ URL to be detirmined");
{% endhighlight %}

I think what I'll do is put the javascript (or maybe other code if required?) inline with the post, and then embed via an iframe (or just a script tag that embeds it) the khan academy program written with the same source code.
